	   <h1>Change Your Purse from Drab to Fab</h1>
	   <span class="left"><img src="images/purse-makeover/finished-purse.png" alt="Completed Purse Makeover"/></span>
 		<p>When my husband and I helped a friend of ours move, she offered us some of the things she no longer wanted. Included in those things was this hideous, but huge, green purse. I thought - yeah, it's ugly, but I don't really have a purse that's big enough to carry my laptop and everything else. So I took the purse and decided that if I was ever going to use it I had to make some improvements. The result - a gorgeous, classic black purse with added texture. Here's how I did it!</p>
	    <span class="center"><span class="right-padded"><img src="images/purse-makeover/purse-before.png" alt="Green Purse Before Being Painted"/></span><img src="images/purse-makeover/after-purse.png" alt="Green Purse After Being Painted, Black with Texture."/></span>
		
		<h2>Supplies:</h2>
		 <ul>
               		<li>Old or Ugly Purse</li>
           		<li>Acrylic Paint</li>
           		<li>Paint Brush</li>
               		<li>Elmer's Glue</li>
			<li>Damp Cloth</li>
			<li>Cup of Warm Soapy Water</li>
			<li>Q-Tips</li>
        	 </ul>

	    <span class="right"><img src="images/purse-makeover/ready-for-texture.png" alt="Purse Painted Black Except for Top, Elmer's Glue, and Black Acrylic Paint Bottle"/></span>	
	 
		<h2>Directions:</h2>
			<p>Take the damp cloth and wipe down the purse to clean off any dirt or dust. Using your acrylic paint and your paint brush, paint all the surfaces of the purse you <i>do not</i> want            to add texture to. Take extra care when painting around cloth or hardware. If you get paint on the cloth or hardware take q-tip, dip it in the warm soapy water, and use the wet q-tip 				to rub off the unwanted paint.</p>
           	<span class="left"><img src="images/purse-makeover/texture.png" alt="Elmer's Glue on Purse to Add Texture"/></span>
		<br><br>
			<p>Once the paint has dried to the touch, about 1 hour, use the Elmer's glue apply a small bead onto the unpainted sections of the bag in a pattern. Once you've finished you're pattern allow glue to fully dry, 2 - 3 hours. Once the glue has fully dried, paint the textured section of the purse with acrylic paint. Allow the paint to fully dry and set, about 48 hrs. You can now use your purse! Once the paint has fully set it becomes partially water resistant and you can use a wet cloth to clean your purse as needed.</p>

	   <h1>Dipped Wine Bottle</h1>
	   <span class="left"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/dipped_tiny.png" alt="Golden Paint Dipped Wine Bottle"/></span>
 		<p>If your anything like me, you probably have a few wine, champagne, or alcohol bottles going into the recycling each month. My husband and i just celebrated our two year wedding anniversary 			 and we bought a bottle of champagne. The bottle itself was cool - it had already been treated so it had a matte black color, but adding a pop of gold made it functional as a gorgeous 			 indoor or outdoor decoration. So instead of sending those bottles out, reuse them in your own home by following the easy steps below.  </p>
	   <span class="center"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/dipped_supplies.png" alt="Gold paint, Black Bottle, and Red SOLO Cup Supplies"/></span>
		<h2>What You Will Need:</h2>
		 <ul>
                   <li>Wine Bottle</li>
                   <li>Acrylic Paint</li>
	           <li>Painters Tape</li>
                   <li>Disposable Cup</li>
                   <li>Small Cup with Warm Soapy Water</li>  
                   <li>Q-tips</li>
                </ul>
		<h2>Directions:</h2>
                  <p>Take your acrylic paint and pour it into your disposable cup. I filled the Solo cup about 1/4 of the way up.</p>
	  <span class="left"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/paint_cup.png" alt="Gold Paint in Red SOLO Cup"/></span>
		  <p>Use the painters tape on the wine bottle to tape off where you want the paint to stop. Then take your bottle and place it into the disposable cup. Tilt the disposable cup to get the paint on all parts of the bottle you want covered. Pull the bottle out of the disposable cup and allow excess paint to drip off.</p>
	  <span class="right"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/allow_drip.png" alt="Dripping Paint off Golden Upcycled Wine Bottle"/></span>	
	  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	  <p>Once the paint has stopped dripping allow paint to partially dry. After about 15 minutes remove the painters tape. Use the warm soapy water and a q-tip to clean up the edges and remove paint from  	      anywhere you do not want it to be. At this point if you do not like how it turned out you can wash the whole bottle with water to remove the paint and start over. Pour the excess paint from the 	      cup back into the paint container.</p>
	 <br><br><br><br>
         <p>Once the paint has fully dried you can use your bottle indoors or outdoors to add a touch of upcycled personality to your home! Enjoy, be inspired, and go out and create some upcycled   	       	 	        beauty for your home!</p>
