	   <h1>Authentic Southern French Crepe</h1>
	   <span class="left"><img src="images/crepe/crepe_small.png" alt="Strawberry and Whipped Cream Crepe on a Garnished Plate"/></span>
 		<p>Bojour! About a month ago our family hosted a young man named Jules from Nantes, France. In his home town he lived above a creperie and as a thank you he cooked and shared with us this recipe for French Crepes.  This recipe is definitely an indulgence, but even the healthiest of us need those every now and then. Whether you prefer to add sweet fillings, my favorite being fresh strawberries and whipped cream, or savory fillings, such as smoked salmon and feta cheese, this is a delicious recipe for Sunday Brunch or any day of the week. Bon Appetit!
		<p> <strong>Note:</strong> This recipe makes roughly 10 - 12 crepes.</p>

              		<li>1 capful of Vanilla Extract</li>
			<li>Butter (for rubbing on skillet)</li>
			<li><strong>Optional:</strong> 1 capful of Rum</li>
        	 </ul>

		<h2>Supplies:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Medium Bowl</li>
			<li>Dry Measuring Cups</li>
			<li>Liquid Measuring Cup</li>
			<li>Whisk</li>

    <div class="down-left"><h2>Directions:</h2></div>
	<ol>
		<li>Measure out the flour and place into a medium bowl. Use your hands to make a large crater in the center of the flour.</li>
	<span class="center"><img src="images/crepe/flour_crater.png" alt="Flour shaped into a crater inside a teal bowl." /></span>
		<li>Crack the 3 eggs into the center of the flour crater. Next, add only a little bit of milk to the eggs in the center of the flour crater.</li>
	<span class="center"><span class="right-padded"><img src="images/crepe/eggs_in_flour.png" alt="Three eggs, yolks and whites, inside flour crater in teal bowl."/></span><img src="images/crepe/milk_eggs.png" alt="Eggs and Milk inside flour crater"/></span>
		<li>Using your whisk pop the egg yolks. Start by mixing just the center contents of the crater. As that starts to thicken, add a little more milk and flour from the sides of the crater and 	continue to whisk. Continue adding milk and taking flour from the sides of the crater until all of the milk and flour is throughly whisked in. Be forewarned that this will be a whisking frenzy!</li>
		<span class="right"><img src="images/crepe/addingsalt.png" alt="Hand holding a pinch of salt over a bowl of crepe mix"/></span>
		<li>Once you've finished whisking the flour/egg/milk mixture add a pinch of salt, capful of vanilla, and, if you choose, capful of rum. Whisk to fully combine these ingredients.</li>
		<span class="left"><img src="images/crepe/rum.png" alt="Pouring a capful of rum into a crepe mixture"/></span>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<li>Cover your crepe batter with plastic wrap and stick in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes. This batter could be mixed the night before and stored in the fridge overnight.</li>
		<li>To cook your crepes, set your burner on a medium to medium-low temperature. Very lightly butter the skillet. Pour about a half a cup of batter into your skillet and swirl the skillet to get a thin even coat. <strong>Note:</strong> the first crepe <i>always</i> turns out badly.</li>
		<li>The edges of the crepe will start to lift slightly from the pan, at this point you should flip your crepe. You only need to briefly cook the second side of the crepe. Remove crepe from skillet and keep warm as you continue to make the rest of the crepes.</li>

	</ol>
	<p>Enjoy your crepes with an assortment of delicious fillings. We choose to have a very indulgent brunch and had strawberries, whipped cream, nutella, chocolate sauce, and maple syrup.</p>

	   <h1>Change Your Purse from Drab to Fab</h1>
	   <span class="left"><img src="images/purse-makeover/finished-purse.png" alt="Completed Purse Makeover"/></span>
 		<p>When my husband and I helped a friend of ours move, she offered us some of the things she no longer wanted. Included in those things was this hideous, but huge, green purse. I thought - yeah, it's ugly, but I don't really have a purse that's big enough to carry my laptop and everything else. So I took the purse and decided that if I was ever going to use it I had to make some improvements. The result - a gorgeous, classic black purse with added texture. Here's how I did it!</p>
	    <span class="center"><span class="right-padded"><img src="images/purse-makeover/purse-before.png" alt="Green Purse Before Being Painted"/></span><img src="images/purse-makeover/after-purse.png" alt="Green Purse After Being Painted, Black with Texture."/></span>
		
		<h2>Supplies:</h2>
		 <ul>
               		<li>Old or Ugly Purse</li>
           		<li>Acrylic Paint</li>
           		<li>Paint Brush</li>
               		<li>Elmer's Glue</li>
			<li>Damp Cloth</li>
			<li>Cup of Warm Soapy Water</li>
			<li>Q-Tips</li>
        	 </ul>

	    <span class="right"><img src="images/purse-makeover/ready-for-texture.png" alt="Purse Painted Black Except for Top, Elmer's Glue, and Black Acrylic Paint Bottle"/></span>	
	 
		<h2>Directions:</h2>
			<p>Take the damp cloth and wipe down the purse to clean off any dirt or dust. Using your acrylic paint and your paint brush, paint all the surfaces of the purse you <i>do not</i> want            to add texture to. Take extra care when painting around cloth or hardware. If you get paint on the cloth or hardware take q-tip, dip it in the warm soapy water, and use the wet q-tip 				to rub off the unwanted paint.</p>
           	<span class="left"><img src="images/purse-makeover/texture.png" alt="Elmer's Glue on Purse to Add Texture"/></span>
		<br><br>
			<p>Once the paint has dried to the touch, about 1 hour, use the Elmer's glue apply a small bead onto the unpainted sections of the bag in a pattern. Once you've finished you're pattern allow glue to fully dry, 2 - 3 hours. Once the glue has fully dried, paint the textured section of the purse with acrylic paint. Allow the paint to fully dry and set, about 48 hrs. You can now use your purse! Once the paint has fully set it becomes partially water resistant and you can use a wet cloth to clean your purse as needed.</p>

	   <h1>Dipped Wine Bottle</h1>
	   <span class="left"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/dipped_tiny.png" alt="Golden Paint Dipped Wine Bottle"/></span>
 		<p>If your anything like me, you probably have a few wine, champagne, or alcohol bottles going into the recycling each month. My husband and i just celebrated our two year wedding anniversary 			 and we bought a bottle of champagne. The bottle itself was cool - it had already been treated so it had a matte black color, but adding a pop of gold made it functional as a gorgeous 			 indoor or outdoor decoration. So instead of sending those bottles out, reuse them in your own home by following the easy steps below.  </p>
	   <span class="center"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/dipped_supplies.png" alt="Gold paint, Black Bottle, and Red SOLO Cup Supplies"/></span>
		<h2>What You Will Need:</h2>
		 <ul>
                   <li>Wine Bottle</li>
                   <li>Acrylic Paint</li>
	           <li>Painters Tape</li>
                   <li>Disposable Cup</li>
                   <li>Small Cup with Warm Soapy Water</li>  
                   <li>Q-tips</li>
                </ul>
		<h2>Directions:</h2>
                  <p>Take your acrylic paint and pour it into your disposable cup. I filled the Solo cup about 1/4 of the way up.</p>
	  <span class="left"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/paint_cup.png" alt="Gold Paint in Red SOLO Cup"/></span>
		  <p>Use the painters tape on the wine bottle to tape off where you want the paint to stop. Then take your bottle and place it into the disposable cup. Tilt the disposable cup to get the paint on all parts of the bottle you want covered. Pull the bottle out of the disposable cup and allow excess paint to drip off.</p>
	  <span class="right"><img src="images/dipped_bottle/allow_drip.png" alt="Dripping Paint off Golden Upcycled Wine Bottle"/></span>	
	  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	  <p>Once the paint has stopped dripping allow paint to partially dry. After about 15 minutes remove the painters tape. Use the warm soapy water and a q-tip to clean up the edges and remove paint from  	      anywhere you do not want it to be. At this point if you do not like how it turned out you can wash the whole bottle with water to remove the paint and start over. Pour the excess paint from the 	      cup back into the paint container.</p>
	 <br><br><br><br>
         <p>Once the paint has fully dried you can use your bottle indoors or outdoors to add a touch of upcycled personality to your home! Enjoy, be inspired, and go out and create some upcycled   	       	 	        beauty for your home!</p>
