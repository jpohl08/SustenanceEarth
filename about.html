          <h1>How It All Began</h1>
          <p>Sustenance Earth was born from my passions. Living in Santa Barbara has only increased my desire to live a healthy lifestyle, both for myself and family and for the world in general. I often use common household objects and improve them to make them useful or beautiful again. I am still learning about how to cook and what to cook. It's all a fun adventure and I want you all along for the ride. My homepage will be updated every of coupled of days with new content, but please visit the Recipe and Up-cycled Crafts pages to surf through some older posts. Also feel free to contact me. This website is in constant flux at this point and I have a lot of big plans for it, so I could always use suggestions and feedback. Enjoy the good life and live Happy and Healthy!! </p>
          <h2>About Jennie</h2>
          <p>I graduated from college in 2010 with a degree in Chemistry. For a brief while I worked in a drug testing lab before moving to beautiful sunny Santa Barbara, CA with my husband and baby (not as much a baby anymore - he's in kindergarten now!). I took a year to spend time with my little guy and at the closing end of that time I decided to take on a monumental task of creating  website and putting my art and ideas out into the world. Hence the birth of Sustenance Earth. Living a healthy lifestyle is something we focus on in this house. Eating healthy (most of the time) and being active out in the world (we frequently go hiking, play beach volleyball, and splash in the waves). </p>
